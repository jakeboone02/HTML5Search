Introduction
============

HTML5Search.com is a simple single paged app hosted on the Google App Engine that embeds the Google Custom Search engine

The aim of the project is to simply let you search an opinionated (my opinion) collection of the resources that you use to learn about HTML5, JS and CSS.

Are we missing a great site?
----------------------------

If we are missing a site that you think must 110% be in the index then simply fork this project - edit https://github.com/PaulKinlan/HTML5Search/edit/master/static/sites.html and submit a pull request.  I will then review it, and if all goes well your site will be in the index quickly.
